# 🔑 Authentication

## API Token

Authentication for API access is performed using the [JWT standard](https://jwt.io/). To obtain a valid and properly signed JWT token, the partner must access the #Bot section of their private **Telegram** channel with Eulen.

:::warning[]
Note that **_there is no API_** to obtain the authentication token. This token is obtained exclusively through our **_Telegram Bot_**.

:::note[]
*If this option is not available to you, request a token through our communication channels.*
:::

The syntax to generate a new token is as follows:

```
/apitoken <label> <days> [all|deposit|withdraw|user]
```
Required params:
* **`label`** - A completely arbitrary text of your choice, with no spaces, such as `server001` or `apitoken2024`. This label will be used to manage your token later. In the future, you can invalidate your token using this label, for example, if it is no longer in use or has been compromised.
* **`days`** - The number of days the token will remain valid, with **365** (one year) being the maximum.
* **`scope`** - One of the following options: `all`, `deposit` or `withdraw`.

## Example

:::highlight blue
`/apitoken token001 7 all`
:::

Create a token with full access that is valid for 7 days, named **token001**.

## How to use the JWT Token

To authenticate with our API, use the HTTP header in the following format:

:::highlight blue
`Authorization: Bearer <token>`
:::

Replacing `<token>` with the JWT token generated by our Telegram bot.
