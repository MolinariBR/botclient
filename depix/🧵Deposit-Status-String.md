🧵Deposit Status String
The deposit status string gives information about a deposit's current state. These are the statuses that exist today:
canceled - If the payment was canceled by the end user, by our partner or by us. Please contact our team for more details about what happened.
under_review - The payment was received from the end user but is under review by us. If this status takes too long, please let us know.
depix_sent - It means that we received the end user's PIX payment, approved it, and sent the DePix to the partner or specified address. This is probably the status that interests you the most and that you should monitor.
error - If any error occurred during the process, please contact us to find out if the error is reversible or not.
refunded - It means that the amount was refunded to the user who initially made the deposit, probably through a special refund mechanism (MED).
expired - It means that the QR Code expired before the end user could make the payment.
pending - It means that the QR Code has been generated and is awaiting payment.
