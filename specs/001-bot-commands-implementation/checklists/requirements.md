# Specification Quality Checklist: Bot Commands Implementation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-28
**Feature**: specs/1-bot-commands-implementation/spec.md

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Overall Status**: âœ… PASSED - Specification is complete and ready for planning

**Validation Notes**:
- All sections properly completed with concrete, testable requirements
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- User scenarios cover all 23 commands with edge cases
- No clarification markers needed - used reasonable defaults
- Scope clearly defined with 6 priority phases
- Dependencies and assumptions well documented

**Next Steps**:
- Proceed to `/speckit.plan` for implementation planning
- No spec updates required before planning phase</content>
